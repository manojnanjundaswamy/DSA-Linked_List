# DSA-LinkedList Implementations

This repository features Linked List implementations, including Singly, Doubly, and Circular Linked Lists. Covers operations like insertion, deletion, reversal. Each implementation includes a main class that provides an interactive CLI-based interface to use the list functionalities.

## Project Structure

- `singly/`
    - `LinkedList.java`: Implementation of a Singly Linked List.
    - `Main.java`: Main class to run the Singly Linked List operations.
- `doubly/`
    - `DoublyLinkedList.java`: Implementation of a Doubly Linked List.
    - `Main.java`: Main class to run the Doubly Linked List operations.
- `circular/`
    - `CircularLinkedList.java`: Implementation of a Circular Linked List.
    - `Main.java`: Main class to run the Circular Linked List operations.
